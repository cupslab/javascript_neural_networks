This is a modification of the neocortex library
(https://github.com/scienceai/neocortex) for executing neural networks in
JavaScript. The modifications cover: adding suport for RepeatVector and
TimeDistributedDense layers, along with fixing a bug in the JSZ* functions and
supporting custom network encodings.
